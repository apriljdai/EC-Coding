A number can be broken into different sub-sequence parts. 
Suppose a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245. 
And this number is a colorful number, since product of every digit of a sub-sequence are different. 
That is, 3 2 4 5 (3*2)=6 (2*4)=8 (4*5)=20 (3*2*4)= 24 (2*4*5)= 40. 
But 326 is not a colorful number as it generates 3 2 6 (3*2)=6 (2*6)=12. 
You have to write a function that tells if the given number is a colorful number or not.
